Main take away from the five year period, the revenue generated was much lower than the expected goal at $8.14M, profit level was also significantly lower at $0.86M, while the expected goal was $4M. However, the profit margin was higher by 25%, which provides some optimism despite the low KPI's for revenue and profit. 

The greatest revenue was generated by S-Works TT, Helmet, Aniversary Edition at $23,391,900 with a profit margin of 68%. 

The highest profit was generated from Bike kales and the least from clothing at 48.66% and 5.06%, respectively. The profit from within the five-year period has overall increased with slight drops and is forecasted to further increase up to $14.6M or decrease down to $6.8M. 

The Key Influencer Chart helps identify factors that impact a particular outcome. For example, in this report the Key influence chart displays factors affecting the quantity_sold to increase/decrease. It can be seen that the Quantity_sold is more likely to increase when the product category incvolves accessories. According to the average line, 6.95% of the other influencers such as Clothing and Bikes caused quantity sold to increase. 

The decomposition tree was created to get the root-cause analysis of the total revenue by country, product category and age group. Using the drill-through function from the map in the executive view we can click on a specific country and learn more about the total reveneu generated based on country, product category and age group. 

The last page of the project, involved using clustering to identify the different groups formed based on the relationship of qunatity sold and total cost. This was analyzed by also considering the different regions and the quantity of items sold. Three distinct clusters were formed showing how with an increase in quanity sold the total costs were higher. 

Once the project in Desktop was completed I was able to upload it to Power BI Service, look at the security groups, create a dashboard, an app, and paginated reports, inclduing all the information from the dashboard. 

This was a very comprehensive project, which greatly helped me with my preparation and helped me ace my certification. Hope you find this information useful.
